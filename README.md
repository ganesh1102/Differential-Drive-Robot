# Differential-Drive-Robot

This project involves the design and implementation of a controller for a differential drive robot (segbot) that moves along a circular track using a linear quadratic regulator.

This repository includes all relevant files (including a URDF for the segbot). The simulation can be started by running the Jupyter notebook 'GenerateResults.ipynb'.

The performance of LQR was compared to pole placement. Full details of the results can be found in the report included in this repository.
